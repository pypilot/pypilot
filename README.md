# PyPilot - Open Source Marine Autopilot

## Installation

Clone the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/pypilot/pypilot
```

### Dependencies

You could install the dependencies with the following command:

```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Configuration

You may want to run pypilot as a service, see the scripts/debian directory

## Usage

Most of the scripts can be run individually as standalone 
or test programs, some function as clients, other as servers

### servers (only one executes at a time)

These server scripts can be run as tests:
* execute this script directly

`pypilot -- autopilot`

instead of running the complete autopilot these scripts provide a server with specific functionallity.

`pypilot_boatimu`    -- imu specific to boat motions
                      includes automatic 2d/3d calibration and alignment of magnetic sensors
                      * useful for testing the imu (gyros) or even just reading gyros
                      
`pypilot_sensors`    -- test sensor inputs only
                       reads nmea0183 from serial ports or from tcp connections, and multiplexes
                       the output to both nmea0183.
                       listed on tcp port 20220 by default
                       * convert and multiplex nmea0183 data

`pypilot_servo`   --   use to test or verify a working motor controller is detected,
                      can be used to control and calibrate the servo

### clients (run as many of these to connect to a server):

`pypilot_control` -- simple interface to command autopilot

`pypilot_calibration` -- interactive gui for all autopilot calibrations

`pypilot_kivy` -- work in progress kivy control app

`pypilot_client_wx` -- graphical client (wx widgets)

`pypilot_scope` -- plot client with wx widgets (for checked listbox)

`pypilot_client` -- console client

`pypilot_hat` -- autopilot control interface using GPIO pins, with web configuration on port 33333

`pypilot_web` -- python flask application for browser autopilot control
