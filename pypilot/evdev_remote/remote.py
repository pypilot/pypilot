The evdev_remote module provides a command-line tool for interfacing keyboard-like
input devices with the pypilot autopilot.
Devices can be connected through any means that the Linux input event
evdev kernel subsystem supports.
This is commonly USB or Bluetooth, or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

(Any devices listed as an evdev device that produces key events should work, too,
but make sure the selected keyboard device is not your main keyboard,
as it will be grabbed and not be available for typing.)

It listens for key events from selected input devices , maps them to autopilot actions,
and communicates these actions to pypilot.

For customization, users can modify the `KEY_ACTION_MAP` dictionary to change
the mapping of key events to actions. Run the script to see the generated key events.

When using a Bluetooth device, make sure that the device is connected and
paired with the system before running this script.
(For example, using `bluetoothctl` to pair, connect to and trust the device,
 or using the GUI Bluetooth manager on your system.)

Example devices that this was tested with:
* Bluetooth "Media Button" remote controls, showing up with BLE name "SmartRemote":
  * https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007423472957.html
  * https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007811649260.html
* Apple Bluetooth keyboard
* Xbox game controller

Run the script with the path to the device as an argument,
from the pypilot top level directory:
```bash
$ python3 -m pypilot.evdev_remote 4c:5e:a5:86:19:02
```

Or run it with multiple devices, using udev device paths:
```bash
$ python3 -m pypilot.evdev_remote /dev/input/event7 4c:5e:a5:86:19:02
```

Or leave the argument empty to select one device interactively.
